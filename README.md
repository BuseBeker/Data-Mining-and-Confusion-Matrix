# Data Mining and Confusion Matrix

A classification problem in reaching from symptom to diagnosis.

Since data mining will be done, data must be generated. Monte Carlo method was used for this.

After generating the data, the model was generated with the classification algorithms and compared with the confusion matrix.

Finally, their performance was compared based on the confusion matrices.
